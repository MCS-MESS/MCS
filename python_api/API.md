#### Returns

- config_data : dict\
The MCS scene configuration data object.

## MCS_Controller

### end_scene([classification, confidence])

Ends the current MCS scene.

#### Parameters

- classification : string, optional\
Your selected classification for classification tasks. Not required for non-classification tasks.

- confidence : float, optional\
Your classification confidence (between 0 and 1) for classification tasks. Not required for non-classification tasks.

### start_scene(config_data)

Starts a new MCS scene.

#### Parameters

- config_data : dict\
The MCS scene configuration data dict.

#### Returns

- output : MCS_Step_Output\
The MCS scene output data object from the start of the scene.

### step(action[, params])

Runs the given action within the current scene and unpauses the sceneâ€™s physics simulation for a few frames.

#### Parameters

- action : string\
Your selected action string from the list of available actions (like "MoveAhead" or "PickupObject").

- params : dict, optional\
Any action-specific parameters.

#### Returns

- output : MCS_Step_Output\
The MCS scene output data object from after the action and the physics simulation were run. Returns None if you have passed the "last_step" of this scene.

## MCS_Goal

### action_list : list of lists of strings, or None

The list of actions that are available for the scene at each step (outer list index).  Each inner list item is a list of action strings. For example, ['MoveAhead','RotateLook,rotation=180'] restricts the actions to either 'MoveAhead' or 'RotateLook' with the 'rotation' parameter set to 180. An action_list of None means that all actions are always available. An empty inner list means that all actions are available for that specific step.

### info_list : list of strings

The list of information for the visualization interface associated with this goal.

### last_step : integer

The last step of this scene. This scene will automatically end following this step.

### task_list : list of strings

The list of tasks for the visualization interface associated with this goal (secondary to its types).

### type_list : list of strings

The list of types for the visualization interface associated with this goal, including the relevant MCS core domains.

### metadata : dict

The metadata specific to this goal. More details coming soon.

## MCS_Object

### uuid : string

The unique ID of this object, used with some actions.

### color : dict

The "r", "g", and "b" pixel values of this object in images from the MCS_Step_Output's "object_mask_list".

### direction : dict

The normalized direction vector of "x", "y", and "z" degrees between your position and this object's. Use "x" and "y" as "rotation" and "horizon" params (respectively) in a "RotateLook" action to face this object.

### distance : float

The distance along the 2-dimensional X/Z grid from you to this object in number of steps ("Move" actions).

### held : boolean

Whether you are holding this object.

### mass : float

Haptic feedback. The mass of this object.

### material_list : list of strings

Haptic feedback. The material(s) of this object. Possible materials: "Metal", "Wood", "Plastic", "Glass", "Ceramic", "Stone", "Fabric", "Rubber", "Food", "Paper", "Wax", "Soap", "Sponge", "Organic".

### point_list : list of dicts

The list of 3D points (dicts with "x", "y", and "z") that form the outer shape of this object.

### visible : boolean

Whether you can see this object in your camera viewport.

## MCS_Step_Output

### action_list : list of strings

The list of all actions (like "MoveAhead" or "PickupObject") that are available for the next step. May be a subset of all possible actions.

### depth_mask_list : list of Pillow.Image objects

The list of depth mask images from the scene after the last action and physics simulation were run. This is usually just a list with a single image, except for the MCS_Step_Output object returned from a call to controller.start_scene for a scene with a scripted Preview Phase.

### object_list : list of MCS_Object objects

The list of metadata for all objects in the scene.

### object_mask_list : list of Pillow.Image objects

The list of object mask images from the scene after the last action and physics simulation were run. This is usually just a list with a single image, except for the MCS_Step_Output object returned from a call to controller.start_scene for a scene with a scripted Preview Phase.
